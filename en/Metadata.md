Additional game-specific information. You can add the necessary information to later use in the "Bonus" conditions, for example.

This is an example of metadata for "Everdell," but here you can add any information related to the game.

**Example in JSON:**
```json
{
    "metadata": {
        "cardType": "purple_prosperity",
        "twigs": 3,
        "resin": 3,
        "pebbles": 3
    }
}
```

For example, in this case, as we will see in the conditions, we can query the cards where `cardType` is equal to `purple_prosperity`. You can imagine this for any field you have in your game.
