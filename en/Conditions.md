The list of conditions is used in many areas to obtain bonuses, requirements, cancel, or ignore cards. Depending on where it is applied, it will serve a different purpose. For example, for a bonus that looks for cards in your hand to multiply each card by 5, these would be the conditions it needs to search for.

Hereâ€™s an example where it looks for cards with the identifiers `fire` and `smoke`.

```json
"conditions": [
	{
		"condition": "equal",
		"field": "id",
		"value": "incendio"
	},
	{
		"condition": "equal",
		"field": "id",
		"value": "humo"
	}
],
```

The `conditions` node contains a list with 3 properties:

- **condition**: Type of condition. Can be `"equal"`, `"notEqual"`, `"greater"`, `"less"`, `"greaterOrEqual"`, `"lessOrEqual"`. Example: `"equal"`.
- **field**: Field on which the condition is applied. Can be any common field of the card like "id" or "points", or any of the game-specific fields added in the "metadata" section. Example: `"cardType"`.
- **value**: Value the field must have. Example: `"purple_prosperity"`.
